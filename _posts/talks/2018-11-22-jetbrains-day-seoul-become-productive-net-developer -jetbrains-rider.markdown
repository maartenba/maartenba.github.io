At JetBrains Day Seoul, I had the opportunity to speak about *How to become a productive .NET developer with [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider)*.

## Session abstract

With .NET Core, an explosion of .NET IDE's happened! There's good old Visual Studio, but also VS Code and JetBrains Rider. In this talk, we'll dive into the latter. We'll explore navigation, automatic inspections and quick fixes, code generation, built-in tooling like version control integration and local history and look at the special scenario's the debugger has to offer, like conditional breakpoints. Come to this session to learn about this new (and fast!) kid on the block and learn plenty of tips & tricks to enhance your development productivity.
