This week, I had the opportunity to speak at [NDC Oslo](https://www.ndcoslo.com). The talk I did was "Indexing and searching NuGet.org with Azure Functions and Search", which covers a story of re-building an existing service using a serverless approach, on Azure Functions.

As promised, here are the slides. Recording should become available at some point as well.

## Indexing and searching NuGet.org with Azure Functions and Search

### Session abstract

Which NuGet package was that type in again? In this session, let's build a "reverse package search" that helps finding the correct NuGet package based on a public type.

Together, we will create a highly-scalable serverless search engine using Azure Functions and Azure Search that performs 3 tasks: listening for new packages on NuGet.org (using a custom binding), indexing packages in a distributed way, and exposing an API that accepts queries and gives our clients the best result.

### Session recording

Session recording will be made available in a couple of weeks.
