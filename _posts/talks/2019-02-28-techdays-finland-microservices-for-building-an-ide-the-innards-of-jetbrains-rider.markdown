The nice folks of [TechDays Finland](http://techdaysfi.com) provided me with the opportunity to speak about *Microservices for building an IDE - The innards of JetBrains Rider*. It was nice to be able to talk about some of the internals, architecture and design decisions that were made while building [a .NET IDE - Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider).

If you're interested in the slides, find them below. This story is also avilable as an article [on CODE Magazine: Building a .NET IDE with JetBrains Rider](https://www.codemag.com/article/1811091).

## Session abstract

Ever wondered how IDE’s are built? In this talk, we’ll skip the marketing bit and dive into the architecture and implementation of JetBrains Rider. We’ll look at how and why we have built (and open sourced) a reactive protocol, and how the IDE uses a “microservices” architecture to communicate with the debugger, Roslyn, a WPF renderer and even other tools like Unity3D. We’ll explore how things are wired together, both in-process and across those microservices. Let’s geek out!
