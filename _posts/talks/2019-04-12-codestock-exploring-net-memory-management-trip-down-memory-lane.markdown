That was fun! I had the opportunity to present at [CodeStock 2019](http://codestock.org/) in Knoxville, TN (USA). The conference is for the community, by the community, which means lots of enthusiast people around.

The talk I did was *Exploring .NET memory management - a trip down memory lane*. Slides are available below. Demo code [is available from GitHub](https://github.com/maartenba/memory-demos).

## Exploring .NET memory management - a trip down memory lane

The .NET Garbage Collector (GC) is really cool. It helps providing our applications with virtually unlimited memory, so we can focus on writing code instead of manually freeing up memory. But how does .NET manage that memory? What are hidden allocations? Are strings evil? It still matters to understand when and where memory is allocated. In this talk, we’ll go over the base concepts of .NET memory management and explore how .NET helps us and how we can help .NET – making our apps better. Expect profiling, Intermediate Language (IL), ClrMD and more!
