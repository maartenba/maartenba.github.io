One of my former classmates, <a href="http://www.bartonline.be/" mce_href="http://www.bartonline.be/">Bart Dekeersmaeker</a>, has just created his own <a href="http://www.bartonline.be/" mce_href="http://www.bartonline.be/">blog</a>. He will be posting news from <a href="http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai" mce_href="http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai">Chennai</a>, India, where he currently resides for work. He is outsourced to KBC, and they asked him to go to India. Good luck on your mission, Bart!
