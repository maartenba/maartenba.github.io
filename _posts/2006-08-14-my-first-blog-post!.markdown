<p>Starting today, I will try to regularly post some information about <a href="http://www.balliauw.be/maarten/about-me.php" mce_href="http://www.balliauw.be/maarten/about-me.php">myself</a>, my job, my life, my opinions. Some of my colleagues at work, mainly <a href="http://jopx.blogspot.com" mce_href="http://jopx.blogspot.com">Joris</a>, told me I should start a blog too. He has his blog hosted at <a href="http://www.blogspot.com" mce_href="http://www.blogspot.com">Blogspot</a>, but I really wanted to host it myself. </p> <p>After trying some PHP software (<a href="http://www.wordpress.org" mce_href="http://www.wordpress.org">Wordpress</a>, <a href="http://ww.nucleuscms.org" mce_href="http://ww.nucleuscms.org">NucleusCMS</a>), I decided to write my own software, based on my PHP Framework I also use at <a href="http://www.holidayhome.be" mce_href="http://www.holidayhome.be">Holidayhome.be</a> and <a href="http://www.eurobesthosting.com" mce_href="http://www.eurobesthosting.com">Eurobesthosting.com</a>. You will see that I have not (yet) implemented all "standard" blog features like rating, trackbacks, pings, ... Bad news: it'll maybe become implemented, maybe not. Luckily for all those blog fanatics out there, comments can be made, and I also have an <a href="http://www.balliauw.be/maarten/rss.php" mce_href="http://www.balliauw.be/maarten/rss.php">RSS feed</a> based on using tags. That way, you can build your own <a href="http://www.balliauw.be/maarten/tags.php" mce_href="http://www.balliauw.be/maarten/tags.php">custom-made Maarten feed</a>. </p> <p>The lay-out of my site is just a (heavily modified) template found in DreamWeaver 8, and because I don't feel like spending too much time on drawing, slicing, tweaking, ... a design, it'll stay like this. And to satisfy <a href="http://www.budts.be" mce_href="http://www.budts.be">TeRanEX</a>, the site is made in XHTML. I still have to test it on the W3C validator, so don't shoot me. </p> <p>One more thing: my native language is Dutch, as I'm from Belgium, but I will post in English as much as possible, because most ICT-related information on the Internet is in English. And I have a broader audience that way :-)</p>
