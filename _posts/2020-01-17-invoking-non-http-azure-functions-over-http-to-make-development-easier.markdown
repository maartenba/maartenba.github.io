Last week, I was presenting at [IglooConf](https://www.iglooconf.fi) ([Indexing and searching NuGet org with Azure Functions and Search](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxH133cyns8)). During one of the demos, I casually used a feature we shipped with the latest [Azure Toolkit for JetBrains Rider](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/11220-azure-toolkit-for-rider): when the Azure Functions host is running on a development machine, Rider lets us trigger functions from the gutter by generating an HTTP request for it.

Azure Functions can be triggered over HTTP, regardless of whether they are using an HTTP trigger or not. For HTTP-triggered functions, there's of course an HTTP endpoint we can call, but the runtime also provides an endpoint for non-HTTP-triggered functions!

So instead of having to change the schedule expression on a `TimerTrigger` to see our function get invoked during development, we can invoke it over HTTP, on demand.

```
POST http://localhost:7071/admin/functions/{functionname}
Content-Type: application/json

{}
```

This works for most trigger bindings, and we can even provide data to our function. For example with a `QueueTrigger`, we can pass along the payload of the message it should process (as a string):

```
POST http://localhost:7071/admin/functions/ExampleQueue
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "input": "{ \"name\": \"Maarten\" }"
}
```

This will then trigger our function where we can process that payload:

Having the ability to trigger functions that way makes the development flow much smoother! Check [the Azure docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local#passing-test-data-to-a-function) for more background info.

Enjoy!
