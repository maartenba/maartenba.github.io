First of all, it&rsquo;s cool to see that at least someone considers me as trusted and respected. Next, it&rsquo;s probably a better advertising solution than the <a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a> ads I had earlier. The Lounge will always display ads related to .NET technology, whereas Amazon had its days of displaying lamps and home furniture enhancements.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see how this works out.</p>
