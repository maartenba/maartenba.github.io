<p>Short version: <span style="font-family: Courier New;">Install-Package ProNuget</span> or <a href="http://amzn.to/pronuget">http://amzn.to/pronuget</a></p>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/pronuget"><img style="background-image: none; margin: 5px 0px 5px 5px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: right; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="Pro NuGet - Continuous integration Package Restore" src="/images/image_170.png" border="0" alt="Pro NuGet - Continuous integration Package Restore" width="186" height="244" align="right" /></a>It&rsquo;s been a while since I wrote my <a href="/post/2009/02/17/Announcing-my-book-ASPNET-MVC-10-Quickly.aspx">first book</a>. After I&rsquo;ve been telling that writing a book is horrendous (try writing a chapter per week after your office hours&hellip;) and that I would never write on again, my partner-in-crime <a href="http://www.xavierdecoster.com">Xavier Decoster</a> and I had the same idea at the same time: what about a book on NuGet? So here it is: <a href="http://amzn.to/pronuget">Pro NuGet</a> is fresh off the presses (or on Kindle).</p>
<p>Special thanks go out to <a href="http://www.hanselman.com">Scott Hanselman</a> and <a href="http://www.haacked.com">Phil Haack</a> for writing our foreword. Also big kudos to all who&rsquo;ve helped us out now and then and did some small reviews. Yes Rob, Paul, David, Phil, Hadi: that&rsquo;s you guys.</p>
<h2>Why a book on NuGet?</h2>
<p>Why not? At the time we decided we would start writing a book (september 2011), NuGet was out there for a while already. Yet, most users then (and still today) were using NuGet only as a means of installing packages, some creating packages. But NuGet is much more! And that&rsquo;s what we wanted to write about. We did not want to create a reference guide on what NuGet command were available. We wanted to focus on best practices we&rsquo;ve learned over the past few months using NuGet.</p>
<p>Some scenarios covered in our book:</p>
<ul>
<li>What&rsquo;s the big picture on package management?</li>
<li>Flashback last week: <a href="http://www.nuget.org">NuGet.org</a> was down. How do you keep your team working if you depend on that external resource?</li>
<li>Is it a good idea to auto-update NuGet packages in a continous integration process?</li>
<li>Use the PowerShell console in VS2010/11. How do I write my own NuGet PowerShell Cmdlets? What can I do in there?</li>
<li>Why would you host your own NuGet repository?</li>
<li>Using NuGet for continuous delivery</li>
<li>More!</li>
</ul>
<p>I feel we&rsquo;ve managed to cover a lot of concepts that go beyond &ldquo;how to use NuGet vX&rdquo; and instead have given as much guidance as possible. Questions, suggestions, remarks, &hellip; are all welcome. And a click on &ldquo;<a href="http://amzn.to/pronuget">Add to cart</a>&rdquo; is also a good idea ;-)</p>
