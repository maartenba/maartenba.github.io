Ever since I started developing <a href="http://www.phpexcel.net" target="_blank">PHPExcel</a>, I noticed this option of connecting to CodePlex&#39;s Team Foundation Server using <a href="http://www.teamprise.com/" target="_blank">Teamprise for Eclipse</a> (free CodePlex license <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/CodePlex/Wiki/View.aspx?title=Obtaining%20the%20Teamprise%20Client" target="_blank">here</a>). Back in the days, I was developing using Zend Studio 4, but I recently upgraded to <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/CodePlex/Wiki/View.aspx?title=Obtaining%20the%20Teamprise%20Client" target="_blank">Zend Studio 6 for Eclipse</a>.
</p>
<p>
Now this &quot;<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/" target="_blank">Eclipse</a>&quot; word triggered the idea that perhaps integration of Zend Studio and Team Foundation Server could be something that works. So I downloaded the <a href="http://www.teamprise.com/products/plugin" target="_blank">Teamprise Eclipse plugin package</a>, copied it to the Zend Studio plugins ditrectory. And yes: tight integration of Team Foundation Server with Zend Studio is possible!
</p>
<p>
Let&#39;s rephrase that: it is perfectly possible to use Team Foundation Server in a mixed Microsoft / PHP development team as your main store for source control, work items, reporting, ...
</p>
<p>
Here&#39;s a screenshot of my installation when accessing the CodePlex Team Foundation Server from Zend Studio:
