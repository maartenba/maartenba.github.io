A while back, I signed up for the beta of [Bitbucket Pipelines](https://bitbucket.org/product/features/pipelines), a new continuous integration service from Atlassian, built into Bitbucket. The build system promises easy configuration using YAML files to describe the build steps.  It runs builds in a Docker image, so that means we can also use it for building and packaging .NET Core libraries. Let's see how.

  Want to use <a href="https://bitbucket.org/product/features/pipelines">Bitbucket pipelines</a> to build .NET Core libraries? <a href="https://bitbucket.org/myget/sample-pipelines-dotnet/src/master/bitbucket-pipelines.yml?fileviewer=file-view-default">Grab this bitbucket-pipelines.yml</a> and add it to source control.

## Sample .NET Core library

I created a [simple .NET Core library](https://bitbucket.org/myget/sample-pipelines-dotnet) which contains a useless `Hello.cs` class, and a [project.json](https://bitbucket.org/myget/sample-pipelines-dotnet/src/master/project.json?fileviewer=file-view-default) that holds project metadata. The class itself is not very interesting, the `project.json` file is:

	{
	  "name": "Sample-DotNet",
	  "version": "1.0.0-*",
	  "authors": [ "MyGet" ],
	  "owners": [ "MyGet" ],
	  "projectUrl": "http://www.myget.org",
	  "requireLicenseAcceptance": false,
	  "summary": "A sample dotnet library.",
	  "dependencies": {
	    "NETStandard.Library": "1.6.0"
	  },
	  "frameworks": {
	    "netstandard1.6": {
	      "imports": "dnxcore50"
	    }
	  }
	}

To redistribute a .NET Core library, there are a couple of items we need in here. First of all, we want to name our library. We can omit this in `project.json`, but that creates an ugly-looking NuGet package name later on so let's be good citizens and add a name. Next, we need a version. Versions should follow [Semantic Versioning](http://www.semver.org) so we can make it clear to our users what they will get when they upgrade our package to a newer version. Let's start at `1.0.0-*` (more on the `*` later) and have our Bitbucket pipeline handle prerelease version increments on each build.

## Creating a bitbucket-pipelines.yml

The [bitbucket-pipelines.yml file](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/configure-bitbucket-pipelines-yml-792298910.html) is where build configuration happens. Generally, it will contain:

* The Docker image to use for running the build
* The build steps involved
* Optionally, each branch can have other build steps configured as well

So let's start at the beginning: the Docker image. To be able to build, test and package our library, we need a Docker image that has the .NET Core runtime installed. Luckily for us, Microsoft [provides a .NET Core Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet/) in the Docker hub. We'll be using the *onbuild* image, as it holds both the runtime and the tools required to build and package sources. In the below `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` file, this image is referenced on the first line.

Next, we'll add our build steps. Under the *pipelines \| default \| step \| script* node, we can write out our build steps. Here's what we want to do:

* Generate a version number (so each time we build, the package version number increases). We can do this using a simple git command, fetching the number of commits on the current branch (`git log --oneline | wc -l`). To be able to use the value later on when creating our package, we can assign it to an environment variable.

* Restore dependencies. Our sample library does not have any dependencies listed, but pretty much any proper library will have dependencies listed in `project.json` so let's run a `dotnet restore`.

* Build sources. We want to make sure our code compiles, which can be done using a `dotnet build`.

* The next step is where packaging happens. We want to create a NuGet package for our library, based on the metadata from our `project.json` and the build number we created as the first step in this pipeline. Remember the version `1.0.0-*`? We'll replace the `*` with a suffix that holds our build number, so that the generated NuGet package has a nice, incrementing version number each time we have a change to our source code.

* Unfortunately, the .NET Core command line does not have a `push` command (yet) for publishing the generated NuGet package to an external feed like [MyGet](http://www.myget.org).On the bright side, the NuGet API for pushing packages is not that complicated and we can do a simple HTTP POST using curl: `curl -X POST "https://www.myget.org/F/myfeed/api/v2/package" -H "X-NuGet-ApiKey: <api key goes here>" -T <package.nupkg>`

In the below `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` file, I introduced some environment variables for specifying the build configuration, NuGet feed URL and API key. I also added a one-liner that pushes every generated NuGet package instead of just one, so that it's easier to copy/paste the below and get up and running fast.

	image: microsoft/dotnet:onbuild
	pipelines:
	  default:
	    - step:
	        script:
	          # Generate build number
	          - BUILD_NUMBER=`git log --oneline | wc -l`
	          - echo "Build number':' ${BUILD_NUMBER}"
	          # Restore packages
	          - dotnet restore
	          # Build project
	          - dotnet build
	          # Run tests
	          # - dotnet test
	          # Create package
	          - dotnet pack --configuration ${BUILD_CONFIGURATION} --version-suffix=beta-$BUILD_NUMBER project.json
	          # Push generated package(s)
	          - "for file in bin/${BUILD_CONFIGURATION}/*.nupkg; do curl -X POST \"${MYGET_NUGET_URL}/package\" -H \"X-NuGet-ApiKey: ${MYGET_NUGET_APIKEY}\" -T $file; done"

Are we there yet? Almost! Feel free to copy the [bitbucket-pipelines.yml](https://bitbucket.org/myget/sample-pipelines-dotnet/src/master/bitbucket-pipelines.yml?fileviewer=file-view-default) file into your project, and then...

## Configure pipeline environment variables

When using my sample [bitbucket-pipelines.yml](https://bitbucket.org/myget/sample-pipelines-dotnet/src/master/bitbucket-pipelines.yml?fileviewer=file-view-default), you may find there are a couple of environment variables to be set:

* `MYGET_NUGET_URL`: The full URL of the NuGet feed on MyGet
* `MYGET_NUGET_APIKEY`: MyGet API key
* `BUILD_CONFIGURATION`: Build configuration (Debug/Release)

Open your Bitbucket repository and select ***Settings \| Pipelines \| Environment Variables***. Add the above keys, and the values that apply to your environment:

[![Environment variables required to push from Bitbucket pipelines to MyGet](/images/2016-08-17-building-nuget-and-npm-using-atlassian-bitbucket-pipelines/environment-variables.png){: .align-center}](/images/2016-08-17-building-nuget-and-npm-using-atlassian-bitbucket-pipelines/environment-variables.png)

Note that for the API key, I used a secured variable so the UI shows a mask instead of the actual value.

## Inspecting pipelines output

Once we have a `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` and configure environment variables, we can enable Bitbucket pipelines for our repository (***Settings \| Pipelines \| Settings***) and look at the live output right after a commit:

[![Build log on Bitbucket pipelines](/images/2016-08-17-building-nuget-and-npm-using-atlassian-bitbucket-pipelines/pipelines-output.png){: .align-center}](/images/2016-08-17-building-nuget-and-npm-using-atlassian-bitbucket-pipelines/pipelines-output.png)

Once the pipeline completes, our MyGet feed will contain a new NuGet package version:

[![NuGet package created with Bitbucket pipelines from a .NET Core project](/images/2016-08-17-building-nuget-and-npm-using-atlassian-bitbucket-pipelines/myget-output.png){: .align-center}](/images/2016-08-17-building-nuget-and-npm-using-atlassian-bitbucket-pipelines/myget-output.png)

Pipelines sure look promising! Enjoy!
