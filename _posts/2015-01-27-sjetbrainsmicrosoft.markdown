<p>December 9th, 2012., was my first day at <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com">JetBrains</a>, after being in consultancy for a good 7 years. <a href="http://www.hadihariri.com">Hadi Hariri</a>, my new boss, <a href="https://twitter.com/hhariri/status/278024879062777859">showed the world how new employees are treated</a>. If you know Hadi, that was obviously just for laughs. Not one day have I considered him as a boss, yet as a friend who worked with me on great things. I had a great time in the past two years working with him and the many awesome people at JetBrains. I have traveled a lot, written many blog posts and tutorials (less on my own blog, I admit) and much, much more. Thanks, JetBrains, thanks, community I have worked with, and thanks, Hadi, for making this an awesome time! It’s been a great opportunity and a great adventure.</p> <p>As a moonlighting project, <a href="http://www.xavierdecoster.com">Xavier Decoster</a> and I have been working on <a href="http://www.myget.org">MyGet</a>, a software-as-a-service. It started as a simple prototype, which evolved into a service that hosts thousands of feeds and provides a solution for many developers, OSS projects and companies worldwide. You can find us in the Azure Store, we became VSO Launch partners at TechEd, and we even host nightly builds for ASP.NET and many other Microsoft and non-Microsoft products!</p> <p>But then along came <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a>. The <a href="http://www.nuget.org">NuGet</a> team had an open position (well, two, in fact), for working on the various NuGet tools and the gallery. Both Xavier and myself will be working remotely in this team, starting February. Switching to Microsoft means we can continue our passion and help build a better NuGet. And with the npm and bower support in ASP.NET vNext, we’re pretty sure package management for the .NET developer isn’t going away in the near future…  <p>What does this mean for MyGet? Well, it remains our side business and product. We’ll continue to provide the great service and support you’re used to! The only difference is that both Xavier and my agenda are now more aligned, and we’ll be in package management 24/7.  <p>I’m a bit sad to be leaving JetBrains, but also look very much forward to ’joining Microsoft.</p>
