  Thank you for the informative article, I have a situation which is kind of similar. Is there a way to automate the sandcastle document generation in the build and release pipeline in azure devops.

  I am struggling to find a solution to plug in sandcastle documentation on azure pipeline.

  Can you please let me know if there is a way to do it?
