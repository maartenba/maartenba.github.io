  A follow up, I had to explicitly exclude my DevDrive from anti-virus scans to get improved results.


  This is despite "Virus & Threat Protection - Dev Drive Protection" saying "Performance mode is on to reduce the impact of security scans of your Dev Drive volumes." Seems like a bug maybe, but I can't toggle it on/off either.


  New test results:

  - Lenovo laptop running Win11 Pro 23H2

  - Bitlocker enabled for both NTFS and DevDrive volumes

  - DevDrive partition (not a virtual disk, VHD/VHDX)

  - Power profile "Best performance", plugged in to power

  - i9-12900HX CPU, 64 GB memory


  The disk is probably not the fastest around, so in a way this may help DevDrive shine.


  | NTFS w/exclude AV | DevDrive | DevDrive w/exclude AV |

  | ----------------- | -------- | --------------------- |

  | 31.8              | 33.7     | 14.6                  |

  | 17.8              | 32.7     | 14.7                  |

  | 16.1              | 32.8     | 14.3                  |

  | 15.9              | 32.9     | 14.2                  |

  | 17                | 31.7     | 14.9                  |


  NTFS w/exclude AV: 19.72s average

  DevDrive: 32.76s average

  DevDrive w/exclude AV: 14.54s average (26% faster than NTFS)



  I'm happy to see an improvement at least and I'd say fairly significant and also consistent.

  I'd like to see anti-virus working as advertised, maybe this is fixed in a future update.
