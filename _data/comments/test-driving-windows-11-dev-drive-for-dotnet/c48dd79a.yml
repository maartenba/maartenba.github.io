  Great writeup and you made we want to try this myself!


  But for me it was weird. 

  I just tried it on a laptop with Win11 with bitlocker enabled, and saw a slowdown using DevDrive.


  Ran this on a fairly big solution with 100 projects, timing only the build phase:

  dotnet clean && dotnet restore && time dotnet build


  Repeated test 4 times:

  1. Regular folder c:\dev, excluded from anti-virus - 4 x 14-15 seconds fairly stable

  2. Windrive folder c:\devdrive (not excluded from anti-virus) via VHDX file on same drive - 2 x 15 seconds, 2 x 30 seconds


  I'll test more, it could be a power profile or thermal dethrottling or something, but initial tests were discouraging. Also not sure if it is better to do a full partition for DevDrive or if VHDX should perform equally well.
