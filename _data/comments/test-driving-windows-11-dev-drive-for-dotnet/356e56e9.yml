  I got no speed improvements when building with unity build and massive precompiled headers for c++. However when disabling those the Dev Drive was actually slightly slower to compile than NTFS.

  Both measurements done on folders with MS defender exclusions and I tested against proper Dev Drive partition.

  Fast NVME drives if that matters.
