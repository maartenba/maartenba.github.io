  Perhaps a Durable Functions Orchestration could be an option for the "enqueuer"? (sidestep the issues around needing to be "always on" as the orchestration could track the timestamp, if I've understood correctly).



   I agree, the search service would likely be the bottleneck. It'd be interesting to see how much faster it would run :)
