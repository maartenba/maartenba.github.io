  hey, thanks for the post!

  unfortunately, I tried it on my domain and it didn't work, even with webfinger [dot] net showing the correct data for my user@domain .



  so I tried to find you on mastodon with the username you described on the post, and I couldn't find you as well. I tried with the usernames of a couple of different people (all of them pointing to this post as an inspiration), and none of them appeared too o_o



  I'm not sure if this is working anymore (maybe something related to mastodon v4?)

  any ideas on what could be going wrong? if you need help debugging, please ping me!
