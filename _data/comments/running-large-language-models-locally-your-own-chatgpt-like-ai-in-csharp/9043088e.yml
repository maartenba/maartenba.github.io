  Hello, great tutorial!

  Everything is working fine on CPU (R2700), but i'm trying to figure out what to do to put my GPU (3080 10gb) to work. I got already installed Backend.Cuda12 package (is it ok or it suppose to be Cuda11?). Should i use some specific LLamaParams just for gpu (i guess so but which to use? The only one that is obvious is n_gpu_layers); are there some variables (just for cpu) from the tutorial code to delete? Should i start fresh new project without installing Backend.Cpu? I was searching for the solution online but there's not much about LLamaSharp so haven't found any (or I was looking at one but didn't understood, sometimes I'm dum, also not a programmer). Thanks in advance.
