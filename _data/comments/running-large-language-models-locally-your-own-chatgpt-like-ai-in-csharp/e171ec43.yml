  Thanks for this tutorial!



  I couldn't find a clear answer to this question:

  Can you use LLamaSharp in .NetFramwork applications? The example they have on github works fine in a .NetCore application but when I try it in .Netframework, I get the error:

  “System.TypeInitializationException: 'The type initializer for 'LLama.Native.NativeApi' threw an exception.' RuntimeError: The native library cannot be found.”
