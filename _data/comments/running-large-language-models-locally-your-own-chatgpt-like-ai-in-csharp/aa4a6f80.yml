  Man i'm sure this is a great "tutorial" for everybody that knows what they are doing, but for beginners, this is absolutely useless, and not a "getting started" article.

  create a console?

  install Llama?

  Just copy the models?

  "just" do this and that?

  I tried to do all these steps with the help of google, but nothing works.

  I dont have a "favorite" IDE, i dont have any single one.



  Frustrating.
