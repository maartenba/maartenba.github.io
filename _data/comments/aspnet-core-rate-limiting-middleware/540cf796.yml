message: The IP addresses of the clients are not static, and each IP address can make a maximum of 100 requests in 10 minutes. Additionally, all clients combined can make a maximum of 1000 requests in 10 minutes. When implementing such a rate limit, what do you think is the most appropriate way? Thank you.
