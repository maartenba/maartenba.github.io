  Thanks for a great series about what turns out to be a complex topic.



  You said "even with nullable reference types enabled, you still need to do null checks on untrusted and/or external input."



  That's certainly true. Do you think it is also a good policy to mark these untrusted input parameters as explicitly nullable? This will ensure that the compiler warns me if i modify the code later and accidentally remove the null check.
