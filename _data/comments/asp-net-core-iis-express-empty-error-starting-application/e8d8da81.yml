message: Maarten, thanks for this writeup.  In my case my swagger output was totally inaccessible, always resulting in a 404.  I checked the applicationhost.config file and the IDE had created a /swagger virtual directory pointing to "/"..  I have no idea why it chose to do this, and the same config file from a fresh Swashbuckled project did not have this virtual directory, so I simply deleted applicationhost.config and let the IDE rebuild it - everything works fine now.
