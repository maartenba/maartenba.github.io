  I found exactly the same problem, but caused by 64-bit versions of the aspnetcore dlls and schema (the 32-bit versions were present).



  https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/217361/aspnet-core-2-wont-run-iis-express.html refers to the problem.



  Repairing Visual Studio 2019 fixed the problem for me.



  Note that this was from an almost clean install of Visual Studio 2019.
