  It’s useful to share to everyone that even as of Az Func v4, ONLY string data types are supported for bindings in the isolated process!



  TL;DR:

  Great Blog post and very helpful as there is still zero documentation on using custom bindings in the isolated process model…



  Unfortunately I burned way too many hours getting my binding developed, registered, and running only to then get runtime errors that my type cannot be bound to type String.



  When following the new rabbit hole I found buried in the docs for existing bindings (eg the BlobStorage) when you look at the examples/samples it states that ONLY string data types are supported for bindings in the isolated process…
