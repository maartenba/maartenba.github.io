  Hello,



  Since your (interesting) article, there have been major improvements on .NET C# RegEx engine through .NET 5 & (recently) .NET 7:

  https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/regex-performance-improvements-in-net-5/

  https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/regular-expression-improvements-in-dotnet-7/



  There are some techniques related to the length of the string, to ASCII-limited area, to avoiding useless backtracking, etc.



  With these improvements, your baseline code (possibly adapted for using source generator) might compete with your custom code.
