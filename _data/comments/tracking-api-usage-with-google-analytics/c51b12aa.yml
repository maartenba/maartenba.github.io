  Sessions are also untracked: every event that is tracked counts as a new unique visitor to Google Analytics.

  If you do need to track user sessions, implement a custom IAnalyticsSession and pass it to the constructor of the tracker.

  Looking for a sample code to implement custom IAnalyticsSession. Working on google analytics tracker, my problem is i would want to track users and sessions therefore at the moment every event tracked is counted as a unique user. I kindly need help on this, anyone?
