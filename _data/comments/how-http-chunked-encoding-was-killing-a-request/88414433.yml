message: 'Hi, thanks for the interesting article. There is one thing not right about transfer encoding: "the server tells us it will send a bunch of chunks whenever it has data, and when the response is done it will tell us by closing the connection."; the last part is not correct. When Transfer-Encoding: chunked is used, the server does not close the connection to communicate the end, instead it sends this final sequence of bytes: "\0\r\n\r\n" - signifying that there are no more chunks to be sent.'
