message: "Great Code.\r\n\r\nIt would be super good to have an automated check for @Html.AntiForgeryToken() as well.  \r\n\r\nMVC has better support for faking out the Request and Response objects such that the page can be loaded up in a test and checked.  \r\n\r\nThe tests do run slower and perhaps a little more fragile but worth the analysis to examine the tradeoff."
