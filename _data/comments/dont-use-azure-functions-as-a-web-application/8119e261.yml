message: "Where is the benefit to have many functions instances opposite to monolith? If we have so good scaling, should we care? \r\nAnd yes, I am still sure that middle size monolith is better that hundreds of instances without assigned devops to manage them.\r\n\r\nSo only argument against functions as web api - no pipelines, middleware and some other stuff we can't remember? Pipelines and middleware  can be written in less that 100 rows of code, so is it a problem? \r\nDo you see any other?\r\n\r\nProbably performance may straggle since with functions you will have relatively small one instance size (RAM, CPU) and warm up for complicated API may take a while.
