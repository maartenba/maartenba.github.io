  @Homer It is what it is. Let me reverse your comment: what would be a compelling reason to use HTTP-triggered functions for a full-blown API surface?



  The answer to that question could be describing a scenario where the choice for HTTP-triggered functions makes perfect sense to build a full-blown API. And that would mean there was thought put in, and there was a compelling reason. If there's tremendous value, whether on the technological side or the process side, it means you've considered alternatives and weighed options. Go for it, in such case!



  Open to examples on either side of that spectrum, it could only help those who land here.
