  In order to stop infinite recursive calls you can either:

  1. Stop passing 'options' variable inside JsonSerializer.(De)serialize() call.

  2. Provide a fresh JsonSerializerOptions instance (useful for bringing back default behaviour such as PropertyNameCaseInsensitive = true or setting some custom stuff)



  That way the Deserialization/Serialization calls won't be aware of any custom converters, be it registered by attributes or in startup file.
