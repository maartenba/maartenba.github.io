message: "Hi,\r\nI am wondering which server we should choose asp.net state service.  Can we use asp.net state service on load balancer ? I am not sure that asp.net state service is available on LB or not ?  is it good idea to choose LB state service ? Now , if we can't use LB state service or not available on LB..then is it good idea to choose state service from server 1 or server 2 ?  Kindly provide some input. "
