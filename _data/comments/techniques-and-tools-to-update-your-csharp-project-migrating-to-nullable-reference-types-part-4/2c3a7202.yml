  Thank you for the great articles.

  However, I'm a bit confused with the point:

  >>Add a default value and suppress the warning - Bad!



  At the end of the article you mentioned Entity Framework. When you set up your DbContext you have a list of DbSets. E.g. in my case it looks something like this:

      public DbSet<StyleDbModel> Styles { get; init; } = null!

      public DbSet<ColorDbModel> Colors { get; init; } = null!

      public DbSet<CategoryDbModel> Categories { get; init; } = null!



  As you can see I lie to the compiler, and I don't see a better way to do it here. DbSets always will be not null, because that is how EF works.

  Or maybe I miss something and you know the better approach?
