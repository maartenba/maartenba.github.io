  @Grigory The [Entity Framework docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/miscellaneous/nullable-reference-types#dbcontext-and-dbset) address your question. If you don't want to use the null-forgiving operator, you can alternately use this syntax:



  ```

      public DbSet<Customer> Customers => Set<Customer>();

      public DbSet<Order> Orders => Set<Order>();

  ```



  Hope that helps!
