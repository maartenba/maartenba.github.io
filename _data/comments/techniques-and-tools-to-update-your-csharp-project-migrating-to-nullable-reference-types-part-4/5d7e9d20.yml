  Good question, Ken!



  If you look at compiler output, you'll probably find a `[CS8602] Dereference of a possibly null reference` at the location you are dereferencing the `order`.



  This is one of those cases where R#/Rider have to agree with the compiler. If R#/Rider would say this is okay, but you get the compiler to say otherwise, what's the best answer? I would argue the C# compiler, as that is ultimately the tool that converts your code into something executable.
