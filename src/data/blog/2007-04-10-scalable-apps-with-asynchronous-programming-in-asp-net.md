<p>A while ago, I posted about the DevDays, and some interesting sessions I took. One of these sessions was "Scalable Apps with Asynchronous Programming in ASP.NET", by Jeff Prosise. Searching the Internet, I found that Jeff also published an article on this subject on MSDN, which can be found on the following URL: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/07/03/WickedCode/default.aspx" mce_href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/07/03/WickedCode/default.aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/07/03/WickedCode/default.aspx</a>.</p>
