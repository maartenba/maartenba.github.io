<h2>About the past year</h2>
<p>
Though 2008 seems to have been a year in which I mostly blogged on the <a href="/category/MVC.aspx" target="_blank">ASP.NET MVC framework</a>, the top 3 posts seem to be on PHP and ASP.NET. Still, 2 posts on ASP.NET MVC in my top 5.
</p>
<p>
The past year brought lots of attention to my <a href="http://www.phpexcel.net" target="_blank">PHPExcel</a> and <a href="http://www.phplinq.net" target="_blank">PHPLinq</a> project, both from the PHP side (<a href="http://www.zend.com/" target="_blank">Zend</a>) as well as the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com" target="_blank">Microsoft</a> side. Both projects will continue evolving in 2009, watch out for a huge post on all new features in PHPLinq in January. By the way, I did not blog about a great milestone PHPExcel made: PHPExcel has been downloaded over 120.000 times!
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Blogging about ASP.NET MVC ever since Microsoft started working on that framework also brought me and my blog a lot of attention. The <a href="http://www.cartrackr.net" target="_blank">CarTrackr sample application</a> I created for a <a href="/post/2008/10/15/Introduction-to-ASPNET-MVC-for-VISUG-Presentation-materials.aspx" target="_blank">VISUG session in Belgium</a> has also been downloaded over 800 times.
</p>
<p>
My blog had 115.988 visits in the past year, with currently around 400 unique visits a day (not counting RSS readers of which I don&rsquo;t have any stats unfortunately). Keep spreading the word, keep <a href="/syndication.axd" target="_blank">subscribing to my RSS feed</a>.
</p>
<h2>Looking ahead at 2009</h2>
<p>
2009 will bring more good stuff: continued development on PHPExcel and PHPLinq, more ASP.NET MVC, perhaps some more on Azure or any other new Microsoft technology. Also expect a book on the ASP.NET MVC framework with <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/" target="_blank">Packt Publishing</a>, named &ldquo;ASP.NET MVC Quickly&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s currently in technical review and should be available somewhere near end January.
</p>
<p>
Happy new year 2009 to all my readers! See you around next year.
