<p>Day one of the Belgium Developer &amp; IT Pro days is finished. I've been attending some inspiring sessions. First of all, <a href="http://jelle.druyts.net/" mce_href="http://jelle.druyts.net/">Jelle Druyts</a> showed us a quick overview of the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718948.aspx" mce_href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718948.aspx">Guidance Automation Toolkit</a>. Interesting, and usable in many situations as standard Visual Studio templates do not always fulfill all your needs. </p><p>Afterwards, <a href="http://www.wintellect.com" mce_href="http://www.wintellect.com">Jeff Prosise</a> spoke on using background threads in ASP.NET web sites, and how this can speed things up (a lot!). </p><p>Another session was given by <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dmahugh/archive/2007/03/27/developer-it-pro-days.aspx" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dmahugh/archive/2007/03/27/developer-it-pro-days.aspx">Doug Mahugh</a> on OpenXML. Funny to notice my Prague co-developer also attended his session earlier this week.</p>
