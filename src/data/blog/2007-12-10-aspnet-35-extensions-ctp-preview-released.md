Just over the weekend, Microsoft has <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/12/09/asp-net-3-5-extensions-ctp-preview-released.aspx" target="_blank">released the ASP.NET 3.5 Extensions CTP</a>. This download includes several additions to ASP.NET 3.5: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>ASP.NET AJAX Improvements contains some new AJAX features like browser history support (back-forward), improvements to the JavaScript library, ...</li>
	<li>The new ASP.NET MVC framework which I <a href="/post/2007/11/aspnet-mvc-framework-preview-to-be-released-next-week.aspx" target="_blank">blogged about last week</a></li>
	<li>ASP.NET Dynamic Data Support contains some new features for building a data-driven application much faster.</li>
	<li>ASP.NET Silverlight support</li>
	<li>ADO.NET data services, also known under the name &quot;Astoria&quot;.</li>
</ul>

I&#39;ll be doing some testing during the week, and keep you all informed.
