We do more events (one each month), however this one was way out of our comfort zone. Typically, we have an evening event in which a speaker delivers one session to around 40 attendees. Last Saturday, we organized our first <a href="http://www.azug.be/events/2012-06-02-windows-azure-saturday" target="_blank">Windows Azure Saturday</a>, a hackaton followed by a barbecue.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I will remember about our event&hellip;</p>
<h2>The event</h2>
<p>The idea for a &ldquo;hackaton plus barbecue&rdquo; emerged a couple of months ago. The idea was simple: get a group of Windows Azure enthusiasts together, code for a couple of hours and have a fun barbecue afterwards.</p>
<p>At that time, the idea was small. We&rsquo;ve done some hands-on events under our &ldquo;Code d&rsquo;Azure&rdquo; brand earlier, so we had the idea of having some 10 attendees bringing their laptop, especially since we were planning to host it on a Saturday. We were wrong&hellip;&nbsp; Almost 50 people registered for the hackaton and barbecue!</p>
<h2>&ldquo;10 EUR entrance but you get it back&rdquo;</h2>
<p>On regular events, there&rsquo;s always a number of no-shows. Not a problem although it&rsquo;s always difficult to know how much sandwiches to order. This time we had a barbecue so to ensure we did not order too much meat, we&rsquo;ve asked attendees to pay for the event. If they showed up, they would get their money back. Otherwise the money would be used to cover the cost of the barbecue.</p>
<p>This system worked out well! In fact, people wouldn&rsquo;t have had a problem with the user group keeping their 10 EUR (in fact, some attendees refused to take it&nbsp; back and offered to sponsor their 10 EUR as well).</p>
<h2>Applications developed during the hackaton</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a list of the applications developed during the hackaton:</p>
<ul>
<li>shellR - PowerShell over the web &ndash; A really cool application providing real-time PowerShell to any machine over the Internet.</li>
<li>Autoscaling document translation service &ndash; An autoscaling service which translates PDF and Word documents.</li>
<li>XBox game score comparer &ndash; Compare XBox game scores with your friends. </li>
<li>TwiBo &ndash; A Twitter bot which analyzes a specific hashtag and can retweet based on specific characteristics of the Tweet.</li>
<li>Positive/negative review analyzer &ndash; Analyzing text and giving a positive / negative sentiment score. Great to analyze what people are saying about a specific subject.</li>
<li>Worker role as a service &ndash; Hosting assemblies in a worker role, as a service.</li>
<li>PDF creator service &ndash; Creating PDF files from plain text files.</li>
<li>Service bus webcam picture transmission &ndash; A Netduino streaming webcam pictures over the Windows Azure Service Bus.</li>
<li>BBQ as a Service &ndash; Order BBQ meat via a Windows Phone 7 application.</li>
</ul>
<p>To be honest, I did not expect too many good applications. We only had 3,5 hours to code and a s a developer I know that&rsquo;s almost nothing. Again: wrong. The apps that have emerged were really, really cool! shellR for example (the guys who won the grand prize) was offering a PowerShell console through a browser, which could connect to PowerShell agents around the globe enabling you to manage a computer through your browser. A startup idea in my opinion!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.realdolmen.com" target="_blank">RealDolmen</a> provided us with the location for our event. We were looking for a location that could house 50 attendees and their laptops, had a room to eat (in case of bad weather) and a garden in case of nice weather. Their main office had it all! The weather was nice so we had a great barbecue in their garden.</p>
<p>On a side note: when organizing a party, the guys from <a href="http://lekkerbeest.be/traiteur/start" target="_blank">&rdquo;Lekker Beest&rdquo;</a> are absolute masters in the art of cooking meat and fish! Yummy in the tummy!</p>
<h2>Sponsors</h2>
<p>Thanks to our sponsors, we were able to provide the following prizes to the apps being developed:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 ReSharper licenses sponsored by <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com">JetBrains</a> </li>
<li>2 Cloud Storage Studio licenses sponsored by <a href="http://www.cerebrata.com">Cerebrata</a> </li>
<li>3 one-year MyGet Small subscriptions + a free <a href="http://amzn.to/pronuget">Pro NuGet</a> book sponsored by <a href="http://www.myget.org">MyGet</a> </li>
<li>25 <a href="http://www.pluralsight.com">Pluralsight</a> 1-month subscriptions </li>
</ul>
<p>The first prize was a unique thing: a 2 person Windows Azure North Europe region datacenter tour (flights, dinner, hotel and a tour through the datacenter where you've deployed your app) sponsored by <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to all of our sponsors!</p>
<h2>Wifi</h2>
<p>Every conference has wifi problems. We had none. Which does not mean we didn&rsquo;t have networking issues. The Internet uplink we arranged was an ADSL connection, an &ldquo;asymmetric" digital subscriber line&rdquo;. All blahblah, except for the asymmetric aspect: if someone launched an upload to Windows Azure, others were experiencing a really slow connection. And as uploads were happening all the time, well, guess what: the connection was a bit flakey. This is something we would do different on a future event.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>It was a blast! Have a look at the <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23was12" target="_blank">Tweets</a> around our event. We will definitely do this again. Thank you sponsors, thank you attendees and thank you fellow AZUG board members for making this a splendid event!</p>
