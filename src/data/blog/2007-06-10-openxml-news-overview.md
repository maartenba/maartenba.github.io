<p>A lot of news around OpenXML these days, so I decided to bundle some things into one big blog post. </p><h2>1. Microsoft released a Microsoft SDK for Open XML Formats</h2> <p>In .NET 3.0, there's the System.IO.Packaging API, which allows programmatic access to OpenXML packages (amongst them Office2007 files).<br>Since this API is quite low-level, the Microsoft people introduced a new SDK built on top of System.IO.Packaging, which allows you to use strongly typed classes for document parts. Checkout a <a href="http://blogs.infosupport.com/wouterv/archive/2007/06/05/APIs-for-Office-Open-XML.aspx" mce_href="http://blogs.infosupport.com/wouterv/archive/2007/06/05/APIs-for-Office-Open-XML.aspx">code sample on Wouter's blog</a> and see for yourself: this SDK provides access to an OpenXML package in a much easier way than System.IO.Packaging. Download the SDK <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=AD0B72FB-4A1D-4C52-BDB5-7DD7E816D046&amp;displaylang=en" mce_href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=AD0B72FB-4A1D-4C52-BDB5-7DD7E816D046&amp;displaylang=en">here</a>. </p><h2>2. PackageExplorer 3.0 beta</h2> <p>Wouter <a href="http://blogs.infosupport.com/wouterv/archive/2007/06/08/Package-Explorer-3.0-Beta.aspx" mce_href="http://blogs.infosupport.com/wouterv/archive/2007/06/08/Package-Explorer-3.0-Beta.aspx">released</a> a new (beta) version of his PackageExplorer, and I assume he uses the new SDK mentioned above. Main new feature seems to be adding document parts using a template system, allowing you and I to create an OpenXML package using a set pre-defined templates. You can <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/PackageExplorer" mce_href="http://www.codeplex.com/PackageExplorer">download PackageExplorer</a> on CodePlex. </p><h2>3. Altova XML Spy supports OpenXML</h2> <p>I saw this on Altova's website: <i>"XMLSpy provides powerful support for accessing, editing, transforming, and querying XML data saved in Microsoft® Office 2007 documents and other zipped files."</i><br>Says enough, I think. You can <a href="http://www.altova.com/features_office_2007.html" mce_href="http://www.altova.com/features_office_2007.html">download a free trial</a> to check if this all is true. </p><h2>4. Trying to compile PHPExcel using Phalanger</h2> <p>The last few days, I've been trying to compile <a href="http://www.phpexcel.net" mce_href="http://www.phpexcel.net">PHPExcel</a> to a .NET class library using <a href="http://www.php-compiler.net" mce_href="http://www.php-compiler.net">Phalanger</a>. Phalanger is a PHP compiler for .NET.<br>Compiling works quite well, but not all class definitions are compiled into a usable .NET alternative... Creating and saving a Spreadshete currently works, but adding data into cells doesn't. I guess thats a feature that can not be missing :-)<br>I'll keep you informed on the progress of this. If anyone feels interested in porting this PHP library to C#, please contact me! </p><h2>5. OpenXML for JAVA</h2> <p>JAVA people now also have an OpenXML library: <a href="http://www.openxml4j.org/" mce_href="http://www.openxml4j.org/">OpenXML4J</a>. Not production-stable yet, but alpha versions are available. </p>
