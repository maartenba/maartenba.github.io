Application Architecture is always an interesting topic to read on. Different people have different opinions, there is no one perfect solution to a problem, &hellip; This book covers application architecture, applied to ASP.NET, although these concepts can be applied in any application. Questions like &ldquo;What are tiers?&rdquo; and &ldquo;How do you structure an application?&rdquo; are dug into in the first few chapters. The next chapters focus on more specific areas of application architecture: the domain model, UML, creating an ER diagram, SOA, the ASP.NET MVC framework, &hellip; Each of these concepts is explained using a single project example, which makes it easy to see the differences, pro&rsquo;s and con&rsquo;s of a certain solution. 
</p>
<p>
To be honest, I don&rsquo;t think this book is something for experienced architects or lead developers. More experienced architects will probably remain a little bit hungry because large, complex, real-world architectures are not covered or illustrated. The book covers all concepts of application architecture using a simple example, which makes them clear to any developer who is interested in architecture but has always been affraid of all these concepts. 
</p>
<p>
If you are familiar with the words &ldquo;N-Tier&rdquo;, &ldquo;domain model&rdquo; and other architectural concepts, I think this book might not be covering architecture deep enough. Are you a developer wanting to release some open-source software? Unaware of the concepts mentioned? Then read this book as it is a great starter book.
