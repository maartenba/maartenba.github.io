NuPack is a free, open source developer focused package management system for the .NET platform intent on simplifying the process of incorporating third party libraries into a .NET application during development. If you download and install <a href="http://nupack.codeplex.com/releases/view/52016">NuPack</a> into Visual Studio, you can now reference <a href="http://mvcsitemap.codeplex.com/">MvcSiteMapProvider</a> with a few simple clicks!</p>  <p>From within your ASP.NET MVC 2 project, right click the project file and use the new “Add Package Reference…” option.</p>  <p><a href="/images/image_66.png"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; border-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Add package reference" border="0" alt="Add package reference" src="/images/image_thumb_36.png" width="244" height="37" /></a></p>  <p>Next, a nice dialog shows up where you can just pick a package and click “Install” to download it and add the necessary references to your project. The packages are retrieved from a central XML feed, but feel free to add a reference to a directory where your corporate packages are stored and install them through NuPack. Anyway: MvcSiteMapProvider. Just look for it in the list and click “Install”.</p>  <p><a href="/images/image_67.png"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; border-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="MvcSiteMapProvider in NuPack" border="0" alt="MvcSiteMapProvider in NuPack" src="/images/image_thumb_37.png" width="644" height="446" /></a></p>  <p>Next, MvcSiteMapProvider will automatically be downloaded, added as an assembly reference, a default <em>Mvc.sitemap</em> file is added to your project and all configuration in <em>Web.config</em> takes place without having to do anything! I’m sold :-)</p>  <p><em><strong>Disclaimer for some: I’m not saying NuPack is the best package manager out there nor that it is the best original idea ever invented. I do believe that the tight integration in VS2010 will make NuPack a good friend during development: the process of downloading and including third party components in your application becomes frictionless. That’s the aim for NuPack, and also the reason why I believe this tool matters and will matter a lot!</strong></em></p>
