<p>A nice press release today at Microsoft: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2006/oct06/10-31MSZendPR.mspx" mce_href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2006/oct06/10-31MSZendPR.mspx">Microsoft and Zend Technologies Announce Technical Collaboration to Improve Interoperability of PHP on the Windows Server Platform</a>. Both companies admit that PHP is often developed on Windows systems, but the final server environment is mostly *nix. With this collaboration, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com" mce_href="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a> and <a href="http://www.zend.com" mce_href="http://www.zend.com">Zend</a> will try to change that. </p><p>The specific points of action in this collaboration: </p><ul> <li>Microsoft plans to releas an IIS add-on, FastCGI, that will serve as the interface between PHP and IIS. I talked about <a href="http://www.balliauw.be/maarten/blog/16,php-on-iis7-rc-1-but-unsafe.htm" mce_href="http://www.balliauw.be/maarten/blog/16,php-on-iis7-rc-1-but-unsafe.htm">FastCGI earlier</a>.  </li><li>Zend will establish a Windows testing lab, to maintain high performance of PHP on Windows servers as PHP evolves.  </li><li>Both parties will help to ensure a production-quality PHP environment for IIS 5.1 and newer versions  </li><li>Both parties will provide support to the PHP community, helping developers planning to deploy PHP applications on Windows servers.</li></ul> <p>I think this is nice news! Looking forward to results of this collaboration... </p>
