<p>Just got back from the second and last day at the DevDays. It's all more exhausting than I thought it would be. First of all: driving from Antwerp to Ghent and arrive there in time means to get up early. Second, a lot of information and understanding needs to be processed and absorbed. </p><p>Today, I've attended a session on C#3.0 and what's next by <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/rajpai/" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/rajpai/">Raj Pai</a>. Interesting material, seems to me that C# will evolve into something more declarative and flexible than it already is. </p><p><a href="http://blogs.thinktecture.com/ingo/" mce_href="http://blogs.thinktecture.com/ingo/">Ingo Rammer</a> did a session on Windows Workflow Foundation (WF), very clear and interesting. I've played with it a little in the past, but this talk surely gave me a push into WF's direction (which means I'll be trying this out some more and sleeping a little less ). Make sure you visit his <a href="http://www.thinktecture.com" mce_href="http://www.thinktecture.com">company's website</a> and download his demo code. </p><p>And here's a little hint for everyone who needs entertainment ánd interesting talks: attend a session by <a href="http://www.iserializable.com" mce_href="http://www.iserializable.com">Roy Osherove</a>! Roy did a talk on continuous integration with and without Team System. Things like CruiseControl (which I like) also got touched, not only the Microsoft-related stuff. His sessions always seem to end in a song (with live guitars) which serves as a catchy summary of his talk. </p><p>Conclusion of the past two days: contact <a href="http://jopx.blogspot.com" mce_href="http://jopx.blogspot.com">Joris</a> and make sure he puts me on our company's DevDays attendants list for next year&nbsp;8-)</p>
