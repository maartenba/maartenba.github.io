First things first: WTF is DII??? It&#39;s the &quot;Document Interoperability Initiative&quot; that Microsoft launched. The workshop will be a day filled with presentations from a variety of people, including members of the Office product groups at Microsoft and developers and consultants from several other companies (basically like <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dmahugh/archive/2008/10/26/dii-workshop-recap.aspx" target="_blank">the one held in Redmond</a> a few weeks ago).

<p>
Together with <a href="http://blogs.developpeur.org/neodante/archive/2008/11/28/open-xml-rendez-vous-bruxelles-le-2-d-cembre-pour-une-journ-e-document-interoperability-initiative.aspx" target="_blank">Julien Chable</a>, I&#39;ll be doing a talk on &quot;Document Interop from an Open Source perspective - PHPExcel and OPENXML4J&quot;. Both our open-source products <a href="http://www.phpexcel.net" target="_blank">PHPExcel</a> and <a href="http://www.openxml4j.org/" target="_blank">OPENXML4J</a> will be highlighted with some background and technical demos. We will prove that OpenXML documents provide interoperability between platforms (Windows / Linux) and technologies (.NET, PHP and Java).

Hope to see you there next tuesday!
