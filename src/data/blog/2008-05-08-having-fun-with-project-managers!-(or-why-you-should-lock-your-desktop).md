Have you ever left your computer unattended? (I do hope that!) Do you lock your desktop when this occurs? (I hope so either!) Not locking your desktop can be a risk. Your data might get stolen, someone might install a trojan, ... 
</p>
<p>
My project manager is one of those people who do not lock their computer when away. After having explained that this is a very simple thing he still seems to forget it everytime. Since a few weeks, we are using some more persuasive manners to teach him to press the Windows-key + L whenever he leaves his computer. Some practical jokes... 
</p>
<h2>1. Are those icons?</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
	<div>
	Create a screenshot of the user&#39;s desktop 
	</div>
	</li>
	<li>
	<div>
	Set this screenshot as the desktop background 
	</div>
	</li>
	<li>
	<div>
	Remove all real icons from the user&#39;s desktop (copy them somewhere to cause no real harm!) 
	</div>
	</li>
	<li>
	<div>
	Wait till the user gets back and starts clicking on his desktop &quot;icons&quot;... NOT <img src="/admin/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-cool.gif" border="0" alt="Cool" title="Cool" width="18" height="18" /> 
	</div>
	</li>
</ul>
<h2>2. Cake for everyone!</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
	<div>
	Open the user&#39;s e-mail client 
	</div>
	</li>
	<li>
	<div>
	Send a message to the entire team saying &quot;I&#39;m treating everyone with cake!&quot; (other option: &quot;I&#39;m buying a beer for everyone!&quot;) 
	</div>
	</li>
	<li>
	<div>
	Keep reminding the user of his nice e-mail <img src="/admin/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-cool.gif" border="0" alt="Cool" title="Cool" width="18" height="18" /> 
	</div>
	</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. Right-click here...</h2>
<p>
Here&#39;s a simple one: switch the user&#39;s mouse buttons (control panel - mouse properties - buttons). Also press the CTRL + ALT + Down-arrow. If you&#39;re lucky and the user has an Intl graphics card, his desktop will also be upside down. 
</p>
<h2>4. www.website.com...</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
	<div>
	If you have administrative rights on the user&#39;s PC, find and edit his host file (c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts) 
	</div>
	</li>
	<li>
	<div>
	Add a new entry which map his favourite website to something completely different. For example, map www.google.com to the IP address 208.77.188.166. 
	</div>
	</li>
</ul>
<h2>5. Other funny things</h2>
<p>
We&#39;ve tried the above pranks, but no luck yet... Locking his desktop remains something that&#39;s not important to him (probably because he always has to laugh with practical jokes). Here&#39;s a list of some other jokes we might try in the near future... 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<div>
	<a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000997.html">http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000997.html</a>&nbsp;(remember Clippy, that annoying Office assistant?) 
	</div>
	</li>
	<li>
	<div>
	<a href="http://www.rjlsoftware.com/software/entertainment/fakestart/default.shtml">http://www.rjlsoftware.com/software/entertainment/fakestart/default.shtml</a>&nbsp;(fake the start menu) 
	</div>
	</li>
	<li>
	<div>
	<a href="http://www.rjlsoftware.com/software/entertainment/open_cd/default.shtml">http://www.rjlsoftware.com/software/entertainment/open_cd/default.shtml</a>&nbsp;(randomly open and close his CD drive) 
	</div>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
Any other suggestions, preferrably not harmful? Please let me know!
