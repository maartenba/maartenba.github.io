One of my session proposals made it to the &ldquo;short&rdquo;list for MIX11. One thing left though: votes are the only currency to get my session proposal in Vegas.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the session abstract:</p>


<blockquote>
<h3>Fun with ASP.NET MVC 3 and MEF</h3>
<p>So you have a team of developers? And a nice architecture to build on? How about making that architecture easy for everyone and getting developers up to speed quickly? Learn all about integrating the managed extensibility framework and ASP.NET MVC for creating loosely coupled, easy to use architectures that anyone can grasp.</p>


</blockquote>


<p>If you think this session deserves a place in Vegas, please cast your vote <a href="http://live.visitmix.com/OpenCall/Vote/Session/10">right here</a>. And while you are at it, feel free to vote for both of my direct colleagues <a href="http://live.visitmix.com/OpenCall/Vote/Session/39">Kevin Dockx</a> and <a href="http://live.visitmix.com/OpenCall/Vote/Session/38">Sandrino Di Mattia</a> as well.</p>
<p>PS: No, I will not steal Mike Tyson&rsquo;s tiger.</p>
