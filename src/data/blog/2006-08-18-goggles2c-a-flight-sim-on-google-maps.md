Today, I received a link of a new use: <a href="http://www.isoma.net/games/goggles.html" mce_href="http://www.isoma.net/games/goggles.html">Goggles</a>. Goggles allows you to fly a plane over&nbsp;a city, to climb and descent, to shoot at the scenery (I tried this over Amsterdam but didn't hear anything on the news. It's safe!). You even can crash. </p><p>A while ago I thought on developing a game on Google Maps too. No action-game, no flight simulator, but more a strategic game. Imagine a sort of Risk or Transport Tycoon on satellite imagery. Unfortunately, I didn't find the time to even think about a nice game concept. Maybe once!</p>
