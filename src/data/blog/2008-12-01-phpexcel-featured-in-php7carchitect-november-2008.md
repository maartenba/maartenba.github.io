This weekend, I receievd my electronic copy of <a href="http://www.phparch.com/c/magazine/issue/86" target="_blank">php|architect / November 2008</a> featuring an article on generating PDF and Excel files using PHP. Guess which library is being used in the second part of the article...

While reading the article, I noticed a very cool thing: the author, <a href="http://www.wormus.com/aaron/" target="_blank">Aaron Wormus</a>, is using a convenient way to generate charts in PHPExcel using <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/chart/" target="_blank">Google Charts API</a>. Since PHPExcel currently does not support creating graphs, this is really a good method to use charts in PHPExcel generated Excel files. Here&#39;s a screenshot of the generated file in the magazine:

Sweet!
