Camp" width="252" height="181" align="right" /> I just got the following invitation from Microsoft, and would like to encourage&nbsp; you to participate as well if you are interested in bot PHP and the Microsoft worlds.</p>


<blockquote>
<p><strong>Jump In! and be a part of it!</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p>Open source programming and Microsoft: two incompatible worlds? Microsoft is partnering with renowned actors of the open-source community to organise the <strong>Jump In!</strong> <strong>Developers' Camp</strong> in an effort to combat this misperception<strong>.</strong> Twenty-five knowledge-hungry open source application developers from all over Europe will be invited to spend four unforgettable days of dialogue, networking and workshops at the beautiful Panorama Resort &amp; Spa Feusisberg in Switzerland.</p>
<p>The <strong>Jump In! Developers' Camp</strong> is designed primarily for open-source application developers who are interested in increasing their skills in a range of specific areas. Here they will be able to experiment with ways of combining open-source technologies with Microsoft products to optimize applications. But don&rsquo;t worry: no one is out to &lsquo;convert&rsquo; anybody! The aim instead is to promote interoperability, problem-solving and enhance programming skills. Software experts will be on hand to provide tips and advice, and a range of workshops will be held on topics including Azure, IIS, Silverlight and more in combination with open-source applications. Plenty of time for actual coding will be available.</p>
<p>Potential participants are invited to file an application at <strong><a href="http://www.jumpincamp.com">www.jumpincamp.com</a></strong>, outlining their profile. The 25 developers who are creating the most &ldquo;buzz&rdquo; for themselves and their programming abilities will then be selected. Attendees of the JumpIn! Developers' Camp will then record their impressions and experiences in a live blog for their community of &lsquo;followers&rsquo;. The Camp will be held between <strong>6 - 9 April 2010</strong>.</p>
