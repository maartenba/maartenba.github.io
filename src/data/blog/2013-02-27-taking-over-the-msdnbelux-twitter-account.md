<p>Just a quick post to let you know I&rsquo;ll be taking over the <a href="http://www.twitter.com/msdnbelux">@msdnbelux</a> Twitter account for the next two weeks. This is the official Twitter account for MSDN BeLux. It&rsquo;s not hacked, I did not steal the password: they gave it to me!</p>
<p><a href="/images/image_260.png"><img style="background-image: none; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 5px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="image" src="/images/image_thumb_222.png" border="0" alt="image" width="484" height="336" /></a></p>
<p>The best thing about this takeover is that there are no constraints: I can tweet whatever I want to tweet! So far it's been fun to do, I've seen a lot of reactions on my tweets as well. Let me know how I do! Who knows, I might just change the password and keep this account for myself after these two weeks :-)</p>
<p>Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/msdnbelux">@msdnbelux</a> and I&rsquo;ll provide you with great ASP.NET MVC, ASP.NET Web API, JavaScript and Windows Azure related content.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
