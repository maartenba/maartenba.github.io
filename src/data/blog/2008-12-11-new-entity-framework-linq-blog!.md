<p>
Just a quick recommendation note: One of my colleagues, <a href="http://blogs.securancy.com/" target="_blank">Julien Hanssens</a>, has started blogging on his experiences with the Entity Framework and LINQ. Here are some links to get you started: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://blogs.securancy.com/post/Entity-Framework-ArgumentException-on-Connection.aspx">Entity Framework - ArgumentException on Connection</a><br />
	&quot;A common error while initialising an EntityModel from a WCF Service is the following message: <strong>ArgumentException was unhandled by user code</strong> - The specified named connection is either not found in the configuration, not intended to be used with the EntityClient provider, or not valid. &quot;<br />
	&nbsp; </li>
	<li><a href="http://blogs.securancy.com/post/Entity-Framework-and-Stored-Procedures.aspx">Entity Framework and Stored Procedures</a><br />
	&quot;SQL Server has a large fanbase of stored procedures enthusiasts. Including obviously DBA&#39;s, but also developers. The latter foremost considering that with storedprocs you can easily shovel responsibility at those who are responsible for maintaining data-integrity.<br />
	<br />
	Unfortunately, the ADO.NET Entity Framework in its current version has some limitations when working with stored procedures. How to cope with this?&quot;<br />
	&nbsp; </li>
	<li><a href="http://blogs.securancy.com/post/LINQ-and-Dynamic-Query-Expressions.aspx">LINQ and Dynamic Query Expressions</a><br />
	&quot;By tradition it was always quite a challenge to create custom filtering on objects and dynamically query databases. Or to say least a lot of work. LINQ makes this type of querying in code much easier. In this article I wish to elaborate on the &quot;how-to&quot; and advantages of providing a dynamic and type-safe &#39;engine&#39; for developers on which you can query any random property. <br />
	<br />
	We are going to demonstrate this by using an expression tree, available from the System.Linq.Expressions namespace, to easily achieve dynamic LINQ queries for usage in your code.&quot; </li>
</ul>
