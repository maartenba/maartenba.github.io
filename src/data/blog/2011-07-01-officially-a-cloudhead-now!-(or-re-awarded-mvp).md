I just received the great mail I expect yearly on the first of July:</p>  

<blockquote>   <p>Dear Maarten Balliauw,     <br />      <br />Congratulations! We are pleased to present you with the 2011 Microsoft® MVP Award!

  <p>This e-mail is not that clear about what technology one is an MVP, so I dug in… It seems that I will be leaving the largest group of MVP’s around: ASP.NET (sorry guys, you were great!) and joining the cloudheads of the Windows Azure group.</p>  <p>Thanks everyone for keeping me motivated in working with the community, sharing knowledge and providing me time to do all this. That last one means: thank you, <a href="http://www.realdolmen.com">boss</a>, and thank you to my lovely wife!</p>  <p>Let’s start working on earning the award for next year…</p>
