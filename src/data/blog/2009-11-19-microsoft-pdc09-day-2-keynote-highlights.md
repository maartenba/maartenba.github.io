<p>Day 2 keynote at Microsoft PDC 2009 was quite exciting. To sum things up: Silverlight 4 went beta, IE9 features were previewed, and we got <a href="http://www.microsoftpdc.com/tablet" target="_blank">an external hard disk, nicely fitted in a tablet-pc format</a> case. How thoughtful!</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s some of the novelties:</p>
<p><strong>Silverlight 4 Beta</strong></p>
<p>This was a good starter&hellip; It&rsquo;s really incredibly feature packed! In my opinion, I think WCF can now be called obsolete as well, but no announcements on that :-) Anyway, here&rsquo;s a list of new features: webcam access, multicast streaming, offline DRM and output protection, printing, clipboard support, out-of-browser and out-of-sandbox support, drag and drop, implicit styling, a HTML control, rich-text editing, <em>breathe</em>, ability to share assemblies with .NET 4, data binding improvements, udp multicast, REST enhancements, TCP channel support, &hellip;</p>
<p>Also check Tim Heuer&rsquo;s blog post over at <a href="http://timheuer.com/blog/archive/2009/11/18/whats-new-in-silverlight-4-complete-guide-new-features.aspx">http://timheuer.com/blog/archive/2009/11/18/whats-new-in-silverlight-4-complete-guide-new-features.aspx</a>.</p>
<p><strong>IE9</strong></p>
<p>Yes, IE9 was announced. Running JavaScript lots faster, passing more of the ACID3 test (still not all), and the coolest part: Direct3D rendering of all graphic content. This was demoed and approved by the audience: everything is so muh faster and smoother!</p>
<p><strong>WCF RIA Services</strong></p>
<p>Check out Brad Abrams&rsquo; blog for this: <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/brada/archive/2009/11/18/welcome-to-wcf-ria-services-beta.aspx">http://blogs.msdn.com/brada/archive/2009/11/18/welcome-to-wcf-ria-services-beta.aspx</a></p>
<p>Basically a rename of RIA services, and converted to run on top of WCF rather than an own transport layer implementation in previous versions.</p>
<p>Overall: a great PDC09 day two!</p>
