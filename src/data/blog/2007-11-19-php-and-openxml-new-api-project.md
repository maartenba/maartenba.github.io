<p>
Browsing CodePlex, I found a new PHP OpenXML project named <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/openxmlapi" target="_blank">OpenXML API</a>. From what I can see, this project is just in the &quot;Hello world&quot; stage of creating Word documents in PHP, but not so long ago my&nbsp;<a href="http://www.phpexcel.net" target="_blank">PHPExcel</a> project was in that stage too...

While I am talking about PHPExcel... Since today, the Subversion repository I host myself is synchronized 2 times a week with CodePlex&#39;s Team Foundation Server. If you want the latest source snapshot, please check <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/PHPExcel/SourceControl/ListDownloadableCommits.aspx" target="_blank">PHPExcel&#39;s source code</a> tab on CodePlex.
