<P mce_keep="true">The last few days, I've been working with <A class="" href="http://blogs.infosupport.com/wouterv" target=_blank mce_href="http://blogs.infosupport.com/wouterv">Wouter</A> to discuss some new features and ideas for his <A class="" href="http://www.codeplex.com/PackageExplorer" target=_blank mce_href="http://www.codeplex.com/PackageExplorer">PackageExplorer</A>. PE is an editor for OpenXML packages, enabling you to view the contents and relations of different parts in a package, to validate XML against OpenXML schemes, ...</P>
<P mce_keep="true">One of the cool things we discussed was a HTML start page. Since Visual Studio has one, we decided PE should have one too. After creating a simple mock for this, Wouter was first to Google for a way to embed images and HTML in a resource file, and display it in a fancy start page (second price, for slow Google searchers: I designed the page [&lt;:o)]). You can see the code and build steps required <A class="" href="http://blogs.infosupport.com/wouterv/archive/2007/08/25/Package-Explorer-Start-Page-_2D00_-How-to-use-Win32-resources-and-the-res_3A002F002F00_-protocol-from-.NET.aspx" target=_blank mce_href="http://blogs.infosupport.com/wouterv/archive/2007/08/25/Package-Explorer-Start-Page-_2D00_-How-to-use-Win32-resources-and-the-res_3A002F002F00_-protocol-from-.NET.aspx">over at Wouter's</A>.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">Next cool thing: a new splash screen model. Always wanted to do things right with threads? No more white gaps in your screen due to a blocked UI thread? I suggest you read the eventing and threading explanation at (again) <A class="" href="http://blogs.infosupport.com/wouterv/archive/2007/08/25/The-Package-Explorer-splash-screen_3A00_-Multi_2D00_threaded-application-initialization.aspx" target=_blank mce_href="http://blogs.infosupport.com/wouterv/archive/2007/08/25/The-Package-Explorer-splash-screen_3A00_-Multi_2D00_threaded-application-initialization.aspx">Wouter's blog</A>.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">Next suggestion: <A class="" href="http://www.codeplex.com/PackageExplorer" target=_blank mce_href="http://www.codeplex.com/PackageExplorer">download PE</A>, even if you don't know a thing about OpenXML. Want to learn how to use OO patterns? Always wanted to provide add-in functionality for your own application? PE's code gives a lot of answers on those questions!</P>
